This role is quite small at this point. The majority of its purpose is
to enable Docker at boot since that is not the case by default with Photon.

## Requirements

None yet.

## Role Variables

None yet.

## Example playbook

```
---
- hosts: photons
  sudo: no
  remote_user: root
  roles:
    - photon
```
